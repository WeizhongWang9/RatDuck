# Rat & Duck Tabletop Game

  

## Introduction

  

Rat & Duck is a competitive tabletop game. The story is set in a totalitarian city-state where the government secretly kidnaps civilians for research that grants immortality to the power holders. The opponent team, the dissent, must rescue civilians and spread the truth, eventually overturning such research by causing enough chaos in the city.

A Windows version of the game is provided.

  

# Rulebook
1. Setup

1.1 Two teams of an even amount of players play as the government and the dissent.

1.1.1 The government should have at least 1 police and 1 scientist.

1.2 The map contains 1 prison, 1 police station, 1 lab, and 12 civilian places.

1.2.1 Polices start at the police station.

1.2.2 Scientists and dissents start at the lab.

1.3 A dissent starts the turn.

  

2. Roles

There are three roles in the game: Police, Scientist, and Dissent.

  

Police: A police helps to transport civilians to the lab, arrest dissents, and reduce unrest in places.

  

Scientist: A scientist targets the location of a desired civilian, kidnaps it at the location, and brings it to the lab, so they can perform research.

  

Dissent: A dissent spreads unrest in civilian places and rescues kidnapped civilians. Every successful action grants them a wanted, making them a possible arrest target for police.

  

3. Turn

  

A turn has three states:

Pre-move - the state before a player moves.

Pre-action - the state after the player moved and before the player performs an action

After-action - the state after the player acted.

  

A player always begins with the pre-move state.

  

3.1 Move and the pre-move state

In the pre-move state, a player may spend 1 move point to move to a neighbor location. After that, the state goes to pre-action.

  

3.2 Actions and the pre-action state

Three roles have different actions. In the pre-action state, a player may perform one action. Then the state goes to the after-action state.

  

3.2.1 Immediate action

If an action is immediate, then it can be performed at any time. Furthermore, it does not cause a change in the state.

  

3.3 End-turn

To end a turn, pass the next player to an unplay opponent in this round. If every player has played, this round ends.

  

3.4 Action list:

A list of full actions is given. If the location of an action is ungiven, then treat it as the unit's current location.

Police - Arrest: Sent a dissent with at least 2 wanted to jail. Then reduces 2 wanted of the dissent.

Police - Control: Reduce 1 unrest.

  

Scientist |Immediate| - Target: Obtain a location card, a location card indicates the place of kidnapping. The government can only have 2 location cards at a time.

Scientist - Kidnap: Play a location card in the corresponding location, then put a civilian (research object) in the location.

Scientist - Research: Spend a research object in the lab, then obtain 1 Bio-Sci progress.

  

Police & Scientist |Immediate| - Link/Unlink: Connects a civilian with self, every time you move the civilian moves with you.

  

Dissent - Speak : Increase 1 unrest and obtain 1 wanted. A place can only have 3 unrests.

Dissent - Release : Rescue a civilian, and remove the civilian from the map. Increase 1 unrest if the place has 0-2 unrests, or increase ALL neighbors 1 unrest if the place has 3 unrests. Obtain 1 wanted.

  

4. Game End

The game ends with either

	The government achieves 4 Bio-Sci progress. The government wins.

	The dissent achieves 15 unrests in total. The dissent wins.
